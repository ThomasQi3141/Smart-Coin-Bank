### Smart Coin Bank

A program created with the Arduino platform to count the number and total value of coins in a smart coin bank (quarters, dimes, and nickels). Added three programmable buttons to clear the balance. 

**Step 1:** Install the [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C) library.

**Step 2:** Configure buttons and sensors to their respective ports (Quarters to 13, Nickels to 12, Dimes to 11), (Clear_Quarters to 10, Clear_Dimes to 9, Clear_Nickels to 8). 

**Step 3:** Connect LCD display to ports 16 and 2.

**Step 4:** Download Coin_Bank.ino and upload it to your Arduino through Arduino IDE.

**Note:** Q, D, and N represent the count of Quarters, Dimes, and Nickels, respectively. 

**Next Steps:** Modify as needed.
